Hi there!

This is my first attempt at using the MEAN stack to create a todo app. In the end this will become a personal dashboard and will take the form of a progressive web app notably available from the Chrome Web Store for Chrome OS and for every chrome user.

Help and feedback is greatly apreciated as it is my first attempt at coding and as I don't really know what this app will really become.
